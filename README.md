**.minerva** is a Flash Local Shared Object editor built based on the AMF3 specification and the AMF0 specification.

**.minerva** is capable of reading and writing all known data types successfully. Tested against modern browsers and was built using Chrome 43 and Firefox 38. I do not plan on supporting older browsers unless it's a trivial change. Any issues please click on the support button at the top and enjoy!
